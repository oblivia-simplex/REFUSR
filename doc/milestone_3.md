# "Refuduino": A PLC Busybox 

The "Refuduino" provides a physical platform to demonstrate the effects of the REFUSR System. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 4("RPi") single-board computer(SBC) running OpenPLC[1], an IEC 61131-3 Compliant Open Source Industrial Controller and an Arduino Nano microcontroller wired together at their respective I/O pins. This provides us with a physical platform to demonstrate that code effects generated by the GA-generated programs can be observed & recovered from a physical system and that these effects can be something as simple as a logical truth table. In other words, bits can be real switches, gates can open/close literal flood gates, etc. 

## Interconnects between RPi and Arduino

Note that the VAR declarations in the partial ST code listing on the left correspond with the labels of the GPIO diagram in the center. Input pins on the Pi correspond to output pin declarations on the Arduino code listing on the right. The Fritzing[ref. here] diagram below details the actual wiring between the two devices.

## Demo Video
The link below leads to a video demonstrating the current state of the REFUSR hardware system. The LED activity shows bits being written to the %IX0.n registers, the generate symbolic expression being computed over these bits with respective LEDs indicating the completion of the evaluation and the result written to %QX0.2. An analogue would be the status-and-register-state front-panel from a 1960s-era minicomputer.

# Foundations of the Property Testing Library: Junta Testing

## Adaptive Junta Testing

Based on a preliminary literature review, we identified as state-of-the-art the adaptive junta tester described in “Distribution-Free Junta Testing,” Zhengyang Liu, Xi Chen, Rocco A. Servedio, Ying Sheng, and Jinyu Xie. STOC’18, June 25–29, 2018, Los Angeles, CA, USA. The algorithm 

“Adaptive” refers to not assuming but rather being adaptable to an input distribution of interest. This permits a better theoretical performance, with a polynomial rather than exponential query complexity, and also makes it possible to directly use empirical execution data to learn the probability distribution that the junta tester samples from, so that its results can be most a propos of the part of the input space that is most relevant in practice.

### Novel Automatic Order Search

The algorithm as developed and described in the source paper could only test the junta property of a given order. That is, the junta predicate checking algorithm took the number of input bits _k_ as a parameter and could only reply with an acceptance or probabilistic rejection of a junta of that order.

By identifying the state that could be shared across iterations as the partial list of

# The Cockatrice GP Framework and the REFUSR System (In Progress)

![](https://i.imgur.com/A9PEjMh.png)

`Cockatrice.jl` is a general genetic programming (GP) framework that are developing for use in the REFUSR project (and its sister project, ROPER, which was partially developed under the AIMEE contract, but which falls outside the scope of ReMath). What Cockatrice provides in this case is a multiprocessing system that takes care of the basic evolutionary search architecture: a collection of geographically structured "island" populations are maintained, abstracting away from the details of individual genotypes, their phenotypic expression, and fitness functions, and tournament selection is scheduled and dispatched. 


## Geography

In this particular example, for the sake of simplicity, we'll look at a single island (and single process) evolution. Each island can be structured as the surface of an n-dimensional torus, but we'll stick to two dimensions here. When a tournament is arranged, Cockatrice begins by chosing a random point on the island, and then randomly selects competitors from the neighbourhood of that point. The closer an individual is to the point in question, the more likely their participation in that tournament becomes. The steepness of the distribution curve around that point can be adjusted by tweaking the `locality` parameter in the system's configuration file.

## Linear Genetic Programming in REFUSR

When designing the GP system used in REFUSR, itself, we first considered using a tree-based form of GP, in the tradition of John Koza, where each individual genotype is represented as an abstract syntax tree or symbolic expression. The idea here was that since we're ultimately looking to evolve program specifications (constrained by problem sets and inferred properties), it would be nice if our genotype representation was _already_ "human readable", or expressible as a clear algebraic expression.

This brought us up against certain obstacles in memory and runtime efficiency, however, so we opted for Banzhaf-style linear GP instead, where programs are represented as a sequence of imperative instructions for a virtual register transfer machine -- something resembling an assembly language for a simple architecture. For the time being we're doing without jumps and conditionals, though those could be implemented at a later time. So long as neither jumps nor conditionals are used, however, we can easily translate between linear/imperative and symbolic/functional expressions of programs in our population, and enjoy the advantages of both. It is simpler, on the one hand, to define random generation, sexual recombination (crossover), and mutation for linear programs than it is for syntax trees. On the other hand, it's much easier to apply expression simplification algorithms to syntax trees, and to translate them into systems of constraints for an SMT solver like Z3. Code like the following is sufficient, in fact.


~~~~{.julia}
function to_expr(inst::Inst)
    op = nameof(inst.op)
    dst = :(R[$(inst.dst)])
    src_t = inst.src < 0 ? :D : :R
    src_i = abs(inst.src)
    src = :($(src_t)[$(src_i)])
    if inst.arity == 2
        :($dst = $op($dst, $src))
    elseif inst.arity == 1
        :($dst = $op($src))
    else # inst.arity == 0
        :($dst = $(inst.op()))
    end
end

DEFAULT_EXPR = :(R[1] = false)

function to_expr(code::Vector{Inst})
    code = strip_introns(code, [1])
    isempty(code) && return DEFAULT_EXPR
    expr = pop!(code) |> to_expr
    @assert expr.head == :(=)
    LHS, RHS = expr.args
    while !isempty(code)
        e = pop!(code) |> to_expr
        @assert e.head == :(=)
        lhs, rhs = e.args
        Expressions.replace!(RHS, lhs=>rhs)

### Implicit Fitness Sharing and Interaction Matrices

One of the most serious hazards that an evolutionary process can encounter is a premature collapse of population diversity. This can happen when a particular genetic line $G$ acquires a decisive competitive advantage early in the process by performing very well on a subset $S \subset T$ of the test cases -- a significantly larger subset, let's say, than those handled by competing gene lines. It may be the case that $G$ lacks the computational resources to handle cases outside of $S$, but so long as the rewards meted out by the fitness function are proportionate to the number of cases correctly solved, without regard for the rarity or difficulty of solutions, we may soon see a population dominated almost entirely by recombinations of $G$, each exhibiting strikingly similar behaviour.

One way to offset such a premature convergence and loss of genetic information is to adjust the reward for a test case according to the frequency with which that test case has been successfully solved. This can easily be done by maintaining a data structure called an _interaction matrix_, a 2-dimensional array whose rows represent test cases and whose columns represent individuals in the population. `I[i,j]` is set to `1` if individual `j` solves test case `i`, and `0` otherwise. Each test case can then be assigned a "difficulty" score simply by subtracting the mean of its row from 1. Each individual then receives an award equal to the mean of the difficulty scores for the problems it's solved. 

~~~{.julia}
difficulty_scores = 1.0 .- map(mean, eachrow(INTERACTION_MATRIX))
correct_results   = (!).(answer_vector .⊻ result_vector) # 
adjusted_rewards  = correct_vector .* difficulty_scores
aggregate_reward  = mean(adjusted_rewards)
~~~

#### Interaction Matrices

The loss of behavioural diversity in the poulation where fitness sharing is not in effect is evident to even a visual inspection of its interaction matrices, as shown below. Consistent bars of black and white, spanning multiple columns, indicates a lack of heterogeneity in the population. Note that horizontal locality does have some significance here, since the propagation of genes is probabilistically influenced by geographical structure, as noted earlier.
